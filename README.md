# 🌾 Crop Yield Prediction using Machine Learning 🌾

Welcome to the **Crop Yield Prediction** project! This project leverages various machine learning models to predict crop yields based on weather conditions, pesticide usage, and other relevant data. 🚜

---

## 📂 Files Included

- **`crop_yield_prediction.py`**: The main script that:
  - Loads and preprocesses the data 📊
  - Trains and evaluates multiple machine learning models 🤖
  
- **`data.csv`**: The dataset used for training and testing the models. Contains information such as:
  - Crop yields 🌱
  - Weather conditions ☀️🌧️
  - Pesticide usage 💧
  
- **`README.md`**: This file (you're reading it! 😄)

---

## 💡 Models Used

We’ve implemented several popular machine learning models to predict crop yields, including:

- **XGBoost** 🌟
- **Random Forest** 🌲
- **Linear Regression** 📈
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** 👥
- **Decision Tree** 🌳

---

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

To measure how well each model performs, we’re using:

- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** 📉
- **Accuracy** ✅

⚙️ Models Output
The script will output the following:

Training performance for each model 🎯
Evaluation results based on RMSE and Accuracy 📊
📝 Notes
This is a basic implementation and can be improved by:

Adding more features 🌾
Tuning hyperparameters 🎛️
Selecting the best model 🏆
The dataset used is fictional and serves demonstration purposes only! 🧪

Make sure the data.csv file is located in the same directory as the Python script. 📂
